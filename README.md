Navbar, sidedrawer, audio player, footer and article cards appear differently on mobile device.
</p>
</br>
</br>
Clicking on cards on the home or articles page redirects to the article page. The page is rendered from the SlateJS document object which is stored in the database and
generated by the Slate JS text editor. These articles have been submitted by users and approved by moderators.

Logged in moderators can also see and edit articles that are pending approval.
</p>
The backbone of the website is the SlateJS text editor which appears when the 'Edit' button is pressed and is also present in the comments section of the article
pages. The text editor allows for the use of markup and pictures which simple text areas do not support. The text editor has a save icon on the toolbar which 
uploads the article representation to the MongoDB database. All moderators have permission to edit all articles and articles are approved when moderators press this
save icon. The text editor also supports Keyboard Shortcuts like Ctrl+B for bold and Ctrl+S for save.

</br>
Text editor toolbar contains buttons to change markup, add images and save the post. Articles saved by moderators are approved.
</p>
Comments updates are reflected on the article page in real time. This is done using a socket-io connection between the server and the client. Whenever, comments
are added server broadcasts a message instructing clients to reload. The same procedure is also followed for articles and new articles appear in real time 
when approved.
