He fell\n                in love with Manchester United since 2006 and has never looked\n                back. Ishan is passionate about football and keeps himself busy\n                by learning and reading about football. He’s not only interested\n                in the game but is also drawn to the tactical, statistical, and\n                financial side of football. For the last 4 or 5 years, he has\n                been analyzing these aspects and has written articles/tactical\n                threads where football is cut wide open.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={styles[\"main-pane-item\"]}>\n              <h1 className={styles[\"heading\"]}>\n                Susajjan Dhungana, Co-Founder{\" \"}\n              </h1>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={`${styles[\"main-pane-item\"]} ${styles[\"even\"]} `}>\n              <p>\n                Susajjan is a medical student, born and bred in Kathmandu. He is\n                a sports enthusiast, but football is still his one true love.\n                From listening to football on the radio, during his high school\n                days to watching Gareth Bale bicycle kick his CL dreams away\n                while being surrounded by a group of Real Madrid supporters in a\n                live screening, Susajjan has been through it all as a Liverpool\n                fan. He is a ride or die fan of the club and will do anything to\n                defend his team. Apart from worshiping Jurgen Klopp and\n                Liverpool, he is an avid traveler and loves to explore different\n                places, cuisines, and adventure sports. Susajjan and Ishan are\n                classmates and their daily banter about clubs, and love for\n                football brought them together.\n              </p>\n              <figure\n                className={styles[\"image-container\"]}\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"1200px\" }}\n              >\n                <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/csVqT8O.jpg\" />\n              </figure>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={styles[\"main-pane-item\"]}>\n              <h1 className={styles[\"heading\"]}>Ojash Dangal, Co-Founder </h1>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={`${styles[\"main-pane-item\"]} ${styles[\"odd\"]} `}>\n              <figure className={styles[\"image-container\"]}>\n                <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zGAKRsH.jpg\" />\n              </figure>\n              <p>\n                Also pursuing his career in medicine currently, Ojash is a\n                skeptical, cynical Liverpool fan who’s been following the club\n                since about the last decade. He probably possesses the most\n                knowledge about Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp and the other club\n                employees. He's also someone who’s very fond of the trend of\n                quantifying football via the use of data and metrics. Ojash\n                regularly interacted with Ishan and Susajjan on Twitter and came\n                on board immediately after the idea of creating this podcast was\n                suggested. He is the calm, knowledgable voice in the False 9\n                Podcast and is known for his pages of research before recording\n                an episode. Apart from football, he likes playing snooker and is\n                a connoisseur of good music.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={styles[\"main-pane-item\"]}>\n              <h1 className={styles[\"heading\"]}>Madhu Acharya, Producer </h1>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={`${styles[\"main-pane-item\"]} ${styles[\"even\"]} `}>\n              <p>\n                Madhu Acharya is the co-founder, President, and CEO of Sharecast\n                Initiative Nepal, a not for profit distributing company that\n                focuses on audience data and digital media platforms. He has\n                over two decades of experience in radio program production,\n                training, and media management. Madhu has worked for Internews\n                and the BBC World Service Trust. He started his radio career at\n                Radio Sagarmatha as a producer back in 1996. Madhu is a John S.\n                Knight Fellow at Stanford University (2010-11). He is the\n                producer of the podcast. He is also responsible for all of their\n                equipment, recording, editing, post-production, and release of\n                the podcast. This podcast wouldn’t have been possible without\n                him.
