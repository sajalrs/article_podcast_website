Madhu has worked for Internews\n                and the BBC World Service Trust. He started his radio career at\n                Radio Sagarmatha as a producer back in 1996. Madhu is a John S.\n                Knight Fellow at Stanford University (2010-11). He is the\n                producer of the podcast. He is also responsible for all of their\n                equipment, recording, editing, post-production, and release of\n                the podcast. This podcast wouldn’t have been possible without\n                him. The boys just come up with the content, but he is the\n                brains behind the project and makes everything tick.\n              </p>\n              <figure className={styles[\"image-container\"]}>\n                <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S7gichq.jpg\" />\n              </figure>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={styles[\"main-pane-item\"]}>\n              <h1 className={styles[\"heading\"]}>\n                Sajal Satyal, Webpage Developer{\" \"}\n              </h1>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className={`${styles[\"main-pane-item\"]} ${styles[\"odd\"]} `}>\n              <figure\n                className={styles[\"image-container\"]}\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"1000px\" }}\n              >\n                <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VAt6ABq.jpg\" />\n              </figure>\n              <p>\n                Sajal has just finished his Bachelor's degree in Computer\n                Science. He's a self proclaimed Barca fan. Sajal can't remember\n                the last time he watched a football match but he probably knows\n                more about Barca than Bartomeu. His interest however lies in\n                all things technology. Sajal is a curious person and likes to learn about\n                different things. His witty sense of humor and constant self\n                criticism is the reason he repeatedly challenged himself to do\n                better while making this website.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n  return <Page sidebarFixTopOffset={0} mainPane={contents} />;\n};\n\nexport default AboutUs;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
